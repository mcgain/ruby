An Attempt to make the ruby nil more useful.

Many ruby methods return nil by default, and it takes careful programming to prevent certain classes of errors from occuring.

My plan is to modify the nil class to store the stack trace on invokation. Obviously this will have dire memory and performance implications, so I intend for this to be enabled via a command line argument of the ruby binary.
